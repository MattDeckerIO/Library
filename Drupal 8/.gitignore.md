# Drupal 8 .gitignore
> This file will ignore everything that should not be included in a Drupal 8

### .gitignore
```bash
# This file contains default .gitignore rules. To use it, copy it to .gitignore,
# and it will cause files like your settings.php and user-uploaded files to be
# excluded from Git version control. This is a common strategy to avoid
# accidentally including private information in public repositories and patch
# files.
#
# Because .gitignore can be specific to your site, this file has a different
# name; updating Drupal core will not override your custom .gitignore file.

# Ignore core when managing all of a project's dependencies with Composer
# including Drupal core.
core

# Ignore dependencies that are managed with Composer.
# Generally you should only ignore the root vendor directory. It's important
# that core/assets/vendor and any other vendor directories within contrib or
# custom module, theme, etc., are not ignored unless you purposely do so.
/vendor/
/web/libraries/

# Ignore configuration files that may contain sensitive information.
web/sites/*/settings*.php
web/sites/*/services*.yml

# Ignore paths that contain user-generated content.
web/sites/*/files
web/sites/*/private

# Ignore SimpleTest multi-site environment.
sites/simpletest

# If you prefer to store your .gitignore file in the sites/ folder, comment
# or delete the previous settings and uncomment the following ones, instead.

# Ignore configuration files that may contain sensitive information.
# */settings*.php

# Ignore paths that contain user-generated content.
